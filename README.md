# Network-Performance
A quick project on measuring network performance, spcifically the Round trip time and the goodput (the ratio of useful amount of delivered information to the delivery time)

NetworkPerformance-requests.py has an approach using the requests module. Only measuring a form of the throughput in this module at the moment.

NetworkPerformance-pycurl.py has an approach using the pycurl module, calculating the goodput.
